		<p>Hello, and welcome to my website! I currently work in Marketing for a small ticketing company in Atlanta, GA, but am interested in a variety of things including writing, photography, film, and as of late - web design. You're looking at my very first attempt to build a website from scratch! I apologize for its current state of being.</p>
		<p>A few other things I enjoy:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Live Music</li>
				<li>Meeting New People</li>
				<li>Obsessing Over Dogs (and my current lack of one)</li>
				<li>Eating Good Food</li>
				<li>Discovering New Places in Atlanta</li>
				<li>Driving My Mini Cooper</li>
